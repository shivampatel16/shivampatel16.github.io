						<p> Namaste! (aka Hello!) üôèüèªüòÉ
						</p>
						
						<p> I am Shivam Patel, a second-year graduate student at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a> pursuing the <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-systems-management-master/" target="_blank">Master of Information Systems Management</a> program. I am broadly interested in <i>Software Development</i> and am currently looking for related full-time opportunities (starting July 2023). 
						</p>
						
						<p> Throughout my professional journey, I have participated in various real-life software development and data analytics projects. As a result, I have accumulated a diverse range of unique and enriching professional experiences, which have allowed me to grow both personally and technically.
						</p> 
						
						<p> This semester, I am gaining valuable professional experience through two exciting opportunities. Firstly, as a part of my Capstone Project at Carnegie Mellon University, I am working as a Student Software Developer at <a href="https://www.tcs.com/" target="_blank">Tata Consultancy Services</a>. Additionally, I have partnered with <a href="https://www.marriott.com/default.mi" target="_blank">Marriott International</a> as a Student Social Media Analyst as a part of Carnegie Mellon University's Measuring Social course. Both roles offer a unique chance to apply my skills and knowledge in real-world settings, and I am thrilled to be involved in such impactful projects.
						</p>
						
						<p> My academic and professional background is rich and diverse. Before joining Carnegie Mellon University, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (earning a Gold Medal ü•á) at <a href="https://www.srmist.edu.in/" target="_blank">SRM Institute of Science and Technology</a>, Chennai, India. Additionally, I have undertaken various internship opportunities at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank">NTU Singapore</a>, <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Bombay</a>, and <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Gandhinagar</a> during my undergraduate studies.
						</p>
						
						<p> Before starting my graduate program at Carnegie Mellon University, I worked as a Junior Research Fellow (Software Developer) at the <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar</a>. Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to intern as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.hubble.sh/" target="_blank">Hubble</a>, a tech company based in Adelaide, Australia. These experiences have broadened my horizons, improved my skills, and provided me with valuable insights into the professional world.
						</p>
						
						<p> To conclude, I am an enthusiastic software developer, a curious data analyst, a programmer, an engineer, and a motivated life-long student trying to make the best out of life! Being a proactive problem solver, I possess excellent interpersonal skills. I believe in the power of diversity and collaboration.
